Chicken Potpie TipsHow do I prevent a potpie crust from getting soggy? There are a few ways to prevent a soggy pie crust! Here are our tips:For a single-crust pie, prebake (or blind bake) the crust before filling.Brush the crust with a beaten egg white. This will help seal the crust and prevent the liquid filling from absorbing into the crust.Pour the filling into the crust while it\226\128\153s still hot and immediately place the potpie in the oven. The heat from the filling will help set the crust.Bake the pie on a lower rack in the oven. Since heat is concentrated at the bottom, placing the potpie on the lowest rack ensures the bottom of the crust will bake up crisp and golden brown.Should I poke holes in the bottom of the pie crust? No, we don't recommend poking holes. You shouldn't prick the bottom of a pastry crust when the filling and crust are to be baked together.Can I use a homemade crust? You can absolutely use a homemade crust! In fact, we recommend it. Follow this basic recipe for homemade pie pastry.How do I know when my chicken potpie is done? The potpie is done when the crust is lightly browned and the filling is bubbly. Can\226\128\153t get enough? Bake more comforting potpie recipes.What should I do if the edge of my pie crust slumps? Slumping is when the edge of the crust falls inward off the lip of the pie plate. You can reduce slumping by letting a fluted crust rest in the refrigerator for 30 to 45 minutes.

ReneeMar 18, 2021 I have been making this for the past three years and we love it.   The only thing I did not add was the thyme since my husband and I aren\226\128\153t a fan of it.   Love the fact that I bake one and freeze one each time I make this recipe. AmandaMar 17, 2021 This is such an amazing recipe! Thank you so much. AnnetteMar 14, 2021 A cup of butter and a cup of flour to make the roux for the gravy? Preposterous! I fell for it and ended up throwing out most of the flour/butter mess. It's impossible that other people followed the recipe and gave it any stars at all. I was able to salvage what I had and it ened up quite good, however. Just beware of that cup of butter and cup of flour. Is that a typo or what? MelanieFeb 17, 2021 The best recipe I\226\128\153ve found! I used a deep dish pie pan and it came out beautifully. Will definitely make many times. Shared a photo of it with my daughter who asked me to make her one this weekend! NanFeb 17, 2021 Definitely a winter \"go to\" favorite for my house!  I added a splash of white wine to the final mixture. So yummy! MaureenFeb 17, 2021 Delicious!  Made this tonight and  did not make any changes.  Will be making again, loved it! CarrieFeb 10, 2021 I used unsweetened almond milk to make it dairy free and Bob's red mill G.F flour  and it turned out great!I also threw in a couple cups of chopped fresh baby spinach. WesleyFeb 8, 2021 Made this for the first time tonight and it was bomb. I made some alterations because my family doesn't like English peas. Instead, I stirred in leftover fresh spinach for color and it was all kinds of wonderful. Make sure you use both dark meat and white meat! DFeb 4, 2021 First time making chicken pot pie, this recipe yielded (3)z I used a rotisserie chicken and biscuits on top. It was fantastic. Froze one. <div class=\"recipe-comments__meta-bar\">

Place potatoes and carrots in a large saucepan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, covered, 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain.  In a large skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender. Stir in flour and seasonings until blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in chicken, peas, corn and potato mixture; remove from heat. Unroll a pie crust into each of two 9-in. pie plates; trim even with rims. Add chicken mixture. Unroll remaining crusts; place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in tops.  Bake 35-40 minutes or until crust is lightly browned. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting. Freeze option: Cover and freeze unbaked pies. To use, remove from freezer 30 minutes before baking (do not thaw). Preheat oven to 425\194\176. Place pies on baking sheets; cover edges loosely with foil. Bake 30 minutes. Reduce oven setting to 350\194\176; bake 70-80 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and a thermometer inserted in center reads 165\194\176. Chicken Potpie TipsHow do I prevent a potpie crust from getting soggy? There are a few ways to prevent a soggy pie crust! Here are our tips:For a single-crust pie, prebake (or blind bake) the crust before filling.Brush the crust with a beaten egg white. This will help seal the crust and prevent the liquid filling from absorbing into the crust.Pour the filling into the crust while it\226\128\153s still hot and immediately place the potpie in the oven. The heat from the filling will help set the crust.Bake the pie on a lower rack in the oven. Since heat is concentrated at the bottom, placing the potpie on the lowest rack ensures the bottom of the crust will bake up crisp and golden brown.Should I poke holes in the bottom of the pie crust? No, we don't recommend poking holes. You shouldn't prick the bottom of a pastry crust when the filling and crust are to be baked together.Can I use a homemade crust? You can absolutely use a homemade crust! In fact, we recommend it. Follow this basic recipe for homemade pie pastry.How do I know when my chicken potpie is done? The potpie is done when the crust is lightly browned and the filling is bubbly. Can\226\128\153t get enough? Bake more comforting potpie recipes.What should I do if the edge of my pie crust slumps?

KarenApr 3, 2021 GREAT recipe.........Love the whole recipe....ONE CORRECTION...IT MADE 4 9 inch pies so either half the recipe or make sure you have a lot of freezer space or friends to give them too..LOL... ReneeMar 18, 2021 I have been making this for the past three years and we love it.   The only thing I did not add was the thyme since my husband and I aren\226\128\153t a fan of it.   Love the fact that I bake one and freeze one each time I make this recipe. AmandaMar 17, 2021 This is such an amazing recipe! Thank you so much. AnnetteMar 14, 2021 A cup of butter and a cup of flour to make the roux for the gravy? Preposterous! I fell for it and ended up throwing out most of the flour/butter mess. It's impossible that other people followed the recipe and gave it any stars at all. I was able to salvage what I had and it ened up quite good, however. Just beware of that cup of butter and cup of flour. Is that a typo or what? MelanieFeb 17, 2021 The best recipe I\226\128\153ve found! I used a deep dish pie pan and it came out beautifully. Will definitely make many times. Shared a photo of it with my daughter who asked me to make her one this weekend! NanFeb 17, 2021 Definitely a winter \"go to\" favorite for my house!  I added a splash of white wine to the final mixture. So yummy! MaureenFeb 17, 2021 Delicious!  Made this tonight and  did not make any changes.  Will be making again, loved it! CarrieFeb 10, 2021 I used unsweetened almond milk to make it dairy free and Bob's red mill G.F flour  and it turned out great!I also threw in a couple cups of chopped fresh baby spinach. WesleyFeb 8, 2021 Made this for the first time tonight and it was bomb. I made some alterations because my family doesn't like English peas. Instead, I stirred in leftover fresh spinach for color and it was all kinds of wonderful. Make sure you use both dark meat and white meat! DFeb 4, 2021 First time making chicken pot pie, this recipe yielded (3)z I used a rotisserie chicken and biscuits on top. It was fantastic. Froze one.

The best recipe I\226\128\153ve found! I used a deep dish pie pan and it came out beautifully. Will definitely make many times. Shared a photo of it with my daughter who asked me to make her one this weekend!

A cup of butter and a cup of flour to make the roux for the gravy? Preposterous! I fell for it and ended up throwing out most of the flour/butter mess. It's impossible that other people followed the recipe and gave it any stars at all. I was able to salvage what I had and it ened up quite good, however. Just beware of that cup of butter and cup of flour. Is that a typo or what?

I have been making this for the past three years and we love it.   The only thing I did not add was the thyme since my husband and I aren\226\128\153t a fan of it.   Love the fact that I bake one and freeze one each time I make this recipe.

Chicken Potpie TipsHow do I prevent a potpie crust from getting soggy? There are a few ways to prevent a soggy pie crust! Here are our tips:For a single-crust pie, prebake (or blind bake) the crust before filling.Brush the crust with a beaten egg white. This will help seal the crust and prevent the liquid filling from absorbing into the crust.Pour the filling into the crust while it\226\128\153s still hot and immediately place the potpie in the oven. The heat from the filling will help set the crust.Bake the pie on a lower rack in the oven. Since heat is concentrated at the bottom, placing the potpie on the lowest rack ensures the bottom of the crust will bake up crisp and golden brown.Should I poke holes in the bottom of the pie crust? No, we don't recommend poking holes. You shouldn't prick the bottom of a pastry crust when the filling and crust are to be baked together.Can I use a homemade crust? You can absolutely use a homemade crust! In fact, we recommend it. Follow this basic recipe for homemade pie pastry.How do I know when my chicken potpie is done? The potpie is done when the crust is lightly browned and the filling is bubbly. Can\226\128\153t get enough? Bake more comforting potpie recipes.What should I do if the edge of my pie crust slumps? Slumping is when the edge of the crust falls inward off the lip of the pie plate. You can reduce slumping by letting a fluted crust rest in the refrigerator for 30 to 45 minutes.
